RESUMES AND COVER LETTERS
A resume is a brief, informative summary
of your abilities, education, and
experience relevant to the role you are applying for. It should highlight your strongest assets and skills and differentiate you from other candidates seeking similar positions. Although it alone will not get you a job or internship, a good resume is an important element toward obtaining an interview.
Tailor your resume to the type of position you are seeking. This does not mean that all of your experience must relate directly, but your resume should reflect the skills, experience, and impact the employer would value.

We are regularly asked how students and alumni can most accurately convey their education at the Extension School on their resumes. You’ll find sample formats below for those enrolled in degree programs, earning a certificate, or completing a single class. The degrees earned at HES are Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies and Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies and are commonly abbreviated from their Latin translations as ALB and ALM degrees. When including coursework or foci, awards and honors, projects, or campus involvement in the Education section of your resume, always consider what is relevant to the specific job you are applying for. If you want to go into more detail about projects or campus activities relevant to the employer, you may consider including those details in separate Academic Projects or Volunteer and Activities sections instead of under Education. [For those applying to an HES degree program, follow the resume instructions provided by the Admissions office.]

Liza Wideman Recruiting Coordinator Great Strategy Consulting Firm 200 Shell Fish Blvd, Suite 199 San Francisco, CA 94080
Dear Liza Wideman:
I am writing to express my interest in the Associate position at Great Strategy Consulting Firm. As a Master of Liberal Arts degree candidate at Harvard Extension School, specializing in Information Technology, I come with a solid technical background, a strong interest in business, and a passion for strategy. I have maintained a 3.95 GPA through a well-balanced program of study, enhancing my analytical and technical skills while building my teamwork and leadership capabilities. I am extremely impressed with Great Strategy’s approach to strategy consulting, especially within the Business Development and Innovation practice areas. My academic background, business knowledge and industry experiences have provided me with the credentials needed to thrive as an Associate.
Prior to Harvard, I worked as a technology professional, primarily resolving strategic issues related to technology process improvement. I gained solid research, analytical and problem-solving skills while working in Fortune 500 companies. My background in generating innovative ideas and strategies to improve processes has provided me with a deeper understanding of multifaceted problems that companies encounter in their daily operations. Moreover, because of my work experiences, I fully understand how important it is to have great team dynamics in today’s multi-disciplinary business environment.
To date, my experience as an IT professional has been extremely rewarding and productive. However, it is through strategy consulting that I can use my analytical aptitude and creative problem-solving skills to their fullest. Consulting is a discipline that will force me to view problems not only from the client’s standpoint but also from a marketplace, best practices and “think out of the box” point of view.
I would appreciate the opportunity to interview with Great Strategy Consulting Firm for the Associate position. Please find enclosed my resume for your review. I can be reached via email at jacob.mclean@post.harvard.edu or by phone at (617) 555-3456. I enthusiastically look forward to hearing from you soon.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Jacob A. McLean

Susan Carey Senior Manager Wholesale Wine USA 23 Green St. Boston, MA 02116
Dear Susan Carey:
I am writing to apply for your position in wine wholesale as advertised on Crimson Careers. This exciting opportunity appears to be a wonderful fit with my professional experience, personal interests, and career goals.
I am returning to Boston to complete my final year at Harvard University Extension School, where I am majoring in economics. Having spent the year working and traveling, I am eager to incorporate myself once again into the local wine community, to which I can bring experience in a number of sectors of the industry.
Through eight years in the restaurant field, I have acquired a deep love of and appreciation for wine and cuisine. I have been known to wax rhapsodic over specials; nothing made me happier than discussing a bottle with a table. This enthusiasm allowed me to introduce a list of reserve selections to Shay’s Pub and Wine Bar. The result was an appreciable increase in sales for the restaurant and repeat attendance by customers. My position at Aspen's award-winning Montagna allowed me to expand upon my knowledge of wine, locally inspired cuisine, and the highest standards of service. Our weekly blind-tastings fueled my desire to further myself in this field, and I am in the process of acquiring certification through both the Court of Master Sommeliers and the Wine Spirit and Education Trust.
Most recently, I have returned from France where I was lucky enough to work on an organic vineyard in Beaujolais. I adored working with the young, dynamic, vigneron who ran the estate, the largest of its kind in the region. A position at your wholesale wine company would allow me to draw upon this experience and to facilitate the success of such producers. Additionally, it would enable me to replicate the most enjoyable components of my experience overall: working with my colleagues in the local restaurant industry, as well as with distinctive, iconoclastic wine- makers.
I am readily available via email or phone in order to arrange an interview and have attached my resume below per your request. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Georgina Santiago
