CREATING A POWERFUL COVER LETTER
THE PURPOSE OF A COVER LETTER
Your cover letter is a key aspect of your marketing materials. At the MBA level, many companies will require a cover letter and will give it significant weight in their decision-making process. The goal of your cover letter is to help tell your story in a compelling way that makes the company want to select you for an interview.
PREPARING TO WRITE YOUR COVER LETTER
Successful cover letters are targeted to the firm and position. To create a tailored cover letter, you will need to:
•
Carefully read the job description – what skills and experiences is the company looking for?
•
Research the company to understand recent trends and developments
•
Speak to people affiliated with the company (such as second-years who interned there) to
learn more about the industry/company/role
CREATING YOUR SUCCESSFUL COVER LETTER
Most Sloanies find they need to focus on three areas to create a successful cover letter:
1) Tailor the cover letter to emphasize the skills and competencies highlighted in the job description 2) Demonstrate how you can contribute to the company, not what the company can do for you 3) Tell a compelling story (i.e. not just reiterate your resume)
Included here are examples of job descriptions and successful cover letters and resumes (meaning the students were asked to interview with the company) as well as a checklist to review with your completed cover letters. Note the range of styles – there is no one perfect cover letter template. Each of the following letters has pros and cons, and is meant to demonstrate a range of successful storytelling. The right cover letter for you is one that, combined with your resume, makes the best case for what you can contribute to the company.
BASIC COVER LETTER FORMAT (Ideal font: Times New Roman, 11 or 12pt.)

Your Name Your Street Address, Apartment # Your City, State Zip Code

Dear Ms./Mr. Lastname:
The first paragraph tells the contact person what position you are applying for and why you are applying. If you are applying to jobs where the companies will not be receiving large batches of MIT Sloan resumes, mention your graduation year and the MIT Sloan School of Management somewhere in this first paragraph. Also include where you learned about the position or any connections you have within the company, such as an alumnus or friend at the company who told you about the position. Tell the contact how excited you were to learn about the position and demonstrate some knowledge about the role and the company, as well as why you would be a good fit.
The body paragraph(s) should focus on 3-4 skills, abilities, or experiences you have that you can apply to help the company meet their business goals. You should especially emphasize those skills which match the job description; or the skills you anticipate the job will require, if the job description is not detailed enough. If you are changing careers, ensure that you have highlighted transferable skills and experiences, including activities that you have undertaken while at MIT Sloan to signal your interest in the desired career path. Be sure to provide concrete evidence of the skills you are trying to highlight. Keep the tone professional—share what you can do for them, but avoid language or details that may sound boastful. Emphasize only the most applicable and pertinent parts of your background with persuasive details. Avoid a detailed summary of your career history; you can write this section as one paragraph, two paragraphs, or bulleted information.
The closing paragraph reiterates your interest in the position and the company. If you are responding to a job posting, let the contact know the timeframe in which you will be following up with them to see if an interview can be arranged. If you are applying for an on-campus interview, indicate you are looking forward to seeing them on campus. Thank the reader for their consideration of your candidacy.
Sincerely,
Your Signature (if not an e-mailed letter)

CHECKLIST FOR CREATING IMPACTFUL MIT SLOAN MBA COVER LETTERS
There are many ways to write a great cover letter. Your cover letter is designed to be a complement to your resume, not a repetition of the content. You should select a style that best conveys your preparation for and interest in the position.
While there is no one “correct” style to use, there are a number of key factors to take into consideration as you are reviewing your cover letter. Ask yourself if you have done the following:
Strategy:
□ Is the letter appropriate for and targeted to the specific job and company described? □ Have you stressed what you can do for the company, rather than what the company
can do for you? □ Have you identified key selling points that differentiate and position you as a strong
candidate for the job? □ Does the letter demonstrate your understanding of and appreciation for the
company’s culture and/or business? □ Have you mentioned any positive interactions you have had with current
employees (e.g., speakers or other visitors at company presentations)? □ Does the letter display uniqueness and originality?
Structure:
□ Does the introduction provide an overview of the contents of the letter and pique the interest of the reader?
□ Are the points arranged effectively? □ Have you provided concrete evidence to support your selling points? □ Does your last paragraph outline next steps as appropriate?
Document Design, Clarity, and Correctness:
□ Have you used correct business letter format that includes professional salutation (Dear Ms.Wilkins:) and closing (Sincerely,)? □ Are your selling points easily accessible and able to be quickly skimmed? □ Are the paragraphs coherent and the sentences concise? □ Is the letter free from spelling, punctuation, and grammar mistakes? □ Is the tone appropriate – confident, polite, businesslike? □ Have you thanked the reader for considering your application?

December 17, 2015 Laura Thaler 4 Fayette Park, #2 Cambridge, MA 02139 Mr. Joshua Rollins Recruitment Specialist Quantcast 201 Third Street San Francisco, CA 94103 Dear Mr. Rollins: I am writing to you today to express my interest in a summer internship with the Quantcast Product Group. The Product Strategy role in particular attracted my attention as a great opportunity to build on my strategy consulting experience while aligning with my passion for business technology infrastructure. The discussion at the November company presentation of the evolving digital landscape and Quantcast’s position in that landscape convinced me that my interest in business technology and my analytical approach to problem solving would be well suited to an internship with the company. My follow-up conversation with Carrie Fei, Quantcast Product Manager, increased my certainty that I could deliver great results in a summer internship. I believe the following elements of my working style and skillset would prove especially useful:
•
Analytically oriented: In my consulting work with Keystone Strategy, I frequently found myself pushing for an analytical approach where others did not believe it possible. Especially in projects where data was not immediately available or there were qualitative factors, I relished the opportunity to quantify and systematize our recommendations. In one example, we leveraged interviews with industry experts to map technology clusters both geographically and temporally. With my analysis, we were able to steer our clients to construct their proposed fabrication facility in a knowledge-rich region, rather than in a remote city in the Arabian Desert.
•
Collaborative problem solving: One of my favorite aspects of my prior consulting work was the close collaborations I developed with my clients and team members. I developed this style of problem solving early on in my career when I led the development of a data-driven costing system for a global footwear brand. Over the course of the project, I spent hours white-boarding with our client and meeting with adjacent teams in supply chain operations to deeply understand how our tool might affect the overall system. My level of commitment and collaboration was so valued by the client that I was asked to lead the follow-on implementation work.
•
Passion for analytics technologies: Early in my career, I observed how dramatically data tools can transform business. Ever since, I have had a strong interest in business analytics and its application. This fall, I had the opportunity to conduct an analytics study that helped me better understand the explosion of available data and the evolution of its implementations across industries. Because Quantcast’s products are at the forefront of this movement, the company would be an outstanding match for my long-term career interests.
With my consulting experience and passion for data-driven business technology, I am confident that I could deliver strong results in a summer internship with Quantcast. I look forward to further exploring this opportunity during on-campus recruiting at MIT Sloan. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me for any additional information you might need. Sincerely, Laura Thaler

Example #2 – L.E.K. CONSULTING
Summer Consultant
L.E.K. Consulting is a global management consulting firm that uses deep industry expertise and rigorous analysis to help business leaders achieve practical results with real impact. We are uncompromising in our approach to helping clients consistently make better decisions, deliver improved business performance and create greater shareholder returns. The firm advises and supports global companies that are leaders in their industries — including the largest private and public sector organizations, private equity firms and emerging entrepreneurial businesses. Founded more than 30 years ago, L.E.K. employs more than 1,000 professionals across the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe. For more information, go to www.lek.com. Duties and Responsibilities Summer Consultants at L.E.K. are typically the most experienced case team members dedicating 100% of their time to a single engagement; as a result, the role of the Summer Consultant has a high level of responsibility for guiding and managing the case team, including:
•
Identifying the Critical Issues –Summer Consultants work with Partners and Managers to outline the key business issues needing resolution. L.E.K. Summer Consultants develop the business acumen necessary to quickly identify the key issues early in their career.
•
Structuring Analyses – Once the key issues have been identified, the Summer Consultant typically forms a plan to find the answers to these critical questions. The Summer Consultant will layout the strategy to the team for finding information on market growth drivers, competitive profiling, or broad market trends.
•
Managing the Team’s Day-to-day Activities – L.E.K. hires two undergraduates for every one Summer Consultant, implying that management of less experienced colleagues is as much a part of the Summer Consultant role as solving business issues. A significant responsibility for L.E.K. Summer Consultants is guiding and mentoring more junior Associates on a day-to-day basis.
•
Solving the Case – At the end of the day, our clients expect high quality, actionable answers to their business problems. A Summer Consultant is on point to ensure the team is on-track to accurately solve the problem and deliver an answer. Summer Consultants supervise analyses, develop the structure for the final output, provide quality control, and in most cases, participate in the delivery of the conclusion to senior management at the client.
Why L.E.K. is Different The role of an L.E.K. Summer Consultant is differentiated from the broader market because of five key reasons:
•
Immediate Management Responsibility – L.E.K. hires two undergraduates for every one Consultant - new Consultants have the opportunity to manage Associates from day one.
•
International Experience – Approximately one-third of L.E.K. projects involve an international component, which allows Consultants to work in international case teams or, if they choose, to relocate to international offices on either a temporary or a full-time basis.
•
Upward Mobility – L.E.K. is a meritocracy with a young, entrepreneurial culture. Professionals are promoted commensurate with their capabilities and contribution.
•
Fun, Stimulating Work Environment – The average age of our professional staff is 29, and a strong spirit of camaraderie and helpfulness exists among all levels.
•
Limited Travel –Consultants spend an average of one night a week on the road. Qualifications and Experience Needed L.E.K. seeks highly motivated, creative, and entrepreneurial candidates who possess strong finance skills, effective interpersonal and communication skills, leadership qualities, and uncompromising ethics. International candidates will be sponsored. L.E.K Consulting is an Equal Opportunity Employer
December 12, 2015 Robert Winnick 218 Thorndike St., Apt 110 Cambridge, MA 02141 Ms. Pam Bolotin MBA Recruiter L.E.K. Consulting 75 State Street, 19th Floor Boston, MA 02109 Dear Ms. Bolotin: I am writing to apply for L.E.K.’s Summer Consultant position. After attending L.E.K.’s on-campus presentation, I was impressed with the variety of high-impact work L.E.K. consultants take on, ranging from private equity due diligence to corporate strategy. These exciting challenges along with the firm’s friendly and down-to-earth team members have convinced me that I would be a perfect fit for L.E.K. My time at Citigroup has given me the leadership experience and analytical expertise to make me an excellent consultant at L.E.K. During my time in risk management, I had the opportunity to rotate through three different areas of Citi’s business, which gave me a broad understanding of how a large organization works. In addition to the analytical financial skills I developed in these positions, I also learned how to integrate quickly into a new business area and become an effective member of the team in a short period of time. As the top ranked analyst from my class, I moved into Corporate Strategy where I had the opportunity to work on a variety of the most challenging problems the bank was facing. These projects ranged from remediating regulatory stress tests to advising executives on potential business spinoffs. Working on these projects helped me build a broad business skillset to use in solving unstructured problems and gave me the opportunity to lead changes in a large organization. I also gained experience managing large projects that required interacting with multiple stakeholders including senior executives and employees around the globe, such as leading a firm-wide innovation challenge that engaged thousands of participants. The variety and complexity of the projects I experienced during my time at Citigroup has given me a tremendous tool kit I can bring to L.E.K.’s consulting practice as a summer consultant. After meeting members of the L.E.K. team, I know the organization has a passion for innovative problem solving and delivering real impact, and I hope to become a part of this exciting and dynamic community. I look forward to discussing my experiences further during the interview process, and thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Robert Winnick

December 12, 2015 Marla Wagman 177 River Street, Apt. 1 Cambridge, MA 02139 Mr. Adam Merrill Senior MBA Recruiter Deloitte Consulting 200 Berkeley Street Boston, MA 02116 Dear Mr. Merrill:
I am writing to apply for the Strategy & Operations Summer Associate position at Deloitte. Over the past few months I have met a number of consultants at Deloitte and learned about the company. What has impressed me most is the dedication to individual development and the focus on imbuing innovation into every project and recommendation. I believe the combination of my leadership abilities with my passion for innovation and my strategic and creative analytical thinking will allow me to make a valuable contribution to Deloitte this summer as a Strategy and Operations MBA Summer Associate.
Before business school, I developed digital advertising campaigns for my clients at Digitas. Each client, product and specific objective required a unique perspective, customized insights and deep analysis before, during, and after the campaign. I was working on driving ROI for a credit card one month, and the next month, I was tasked with delivering brand awareness for a new mobile phone. I was able to convince my clients at American Express to adopt a new hybrid campaign model of branding and acquisition, and at L’Oreal, I built a history of success that enabled our agency to recommend and achieve a 140% increase in the digital advertising budget YOY. This experience prepared me to be a nimble and strategic thinker who knows how to deliver results.
While I am able to produce valuable insights and results, I believe my greatest asset is my ability to lead from within. Through my work in client services and leading a cross-functional team, I have learned how to communicate effectively with different stakeholders and inspire them to work together to create meaningful change. I was able to overhaul the existing Digitas billing system by working with employees across multiple functions, meeting with clients to understand their needs and leveraging the expertise of others to build the final product, which reduced errors, increased efficiency, standardized the process and is still in use today.
A significant factor in my ability to lead is my dedication to change and innovation. I am always looking for ways to improve processes, push boundaries and challenge the status quo. I believe that this skill would be especially important as a Summer Associate because it would allow me to provide value from the start as I learn the fundamentals of consulting.
My previous experiences, along with the skills I am currently honing at Sloan, have prepared me to not only take on the challenge of delivering innovative and actionable recommendations, but to also bring new ideas and perspectives to the table. I look forward to exploring a potential internship opportunity at Deloitte this summer and thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Marla Wagman

December 9, 2015 Eric McGillicuddy 33 Sleeper Street, Apt. 504 Boston, MA 02210 Ms. Noelle Clarke Campus Recruiting Specialist Goldman Sachs 200 West Street New York, NY 10282 Dear Ms. Clarke: I would like to express my strong desire to join Goldman Sachs as an Investment Banking Summer Associate. Through my prior work experience, I developed the ability to model complex cash flows, lead cross-functional teams, use data to communicate effectively, and increase operational efficiencies. My career objective has always been to obtain a role at the intersection of finance and the natural resources industry. My prior work experience, strong academic background, and diverse skill set would make me an asset to your firm. After attending the MIT Sloan Banking Day and through informational interviews with members of the Sloan recruiting team, I know I would fit into the Goldman Sachs culture. Prior to attending MIT Sloan, I spent five years at the Demand Response (“DR”) company EnerNOC. As Program Manager in charge of four DR portfolios in California, Idaho, and Arizona, my responsibilities included forecasting annual DR gross profit, customer nominations for Sales, Project Management, and Account Management, calculating curtailment performance for 1,500 assets, and advising Regulatory Affairs on the future of DR in my region. I built dynamic Excel-based kilowatt usage and gross profit projection models and simplified my more complex distribution analyses for Sales and Operations. After three years as Demand Response Program Manager, I was promoted to Senior Financial Analyst in Financial Planning & Analysis. Responsibilities included forecasting company-wide revenues, expenses, and profitability, and senior management level visibility into strategic planning. I worked with 15 department managers on monthly and annual budgeting processes and FTE reviews, suggesting ways to limit headcount and non-personnel OpEx to stay within CFO established EBITDA goals. The cross-organizational nature of the role improved my analytical and interpersonal skillset. My responsibilities required a combination of critical thinking, communication skills and accuracy in a fast paced, highly quantitative environment. My position required guiding Sales to fill capacity commitments and register assets with utilities in a way that maximized revenue while minimizing underperformance risk. I tracked progress against gross profit expectations and handled regulatory change management for each DR season. Finally, I disseminated decisions and strategies to multiple customer-facing teams. These varied skill sets developed at EnerNOC have a strong correlation to success in banking and finance. Thank you for your interest in my application. I am glad to provide references or any other additional information you require. Sincerely, Eric McGillicuddy

November 21, 2015 Carolyn Williams 303 Summer St., Apt. #1 Somerville, MA 02144 Ms. Katie DiGregorio Staffing Associate Genzyme 500 Kendall Square Cambridge, MA 02142 Dear Ms. DiGregorio: It is with great enthusiasm and interest that I am submitting an application for the 2016 Genzyme Commercial MBA Summer Associate Program. My experience working as a healthcare strategy consultant at Putnam Associates has ignited a strong passion to work in the healthcare industry. After my graduation from MIT Sloan, my goal is to join a company where I can directly implement initiatives that will positively affect patients’ lives. Earlier this fall, I had the pleasure of organizing the MIT Sloan Healthcare Club’s visit to Genzyme. In hearing the presentations during the visit and in talking with my former coworker Alaina Pleatman, I was impressed by the emphasis Genzyme places on creative thinking and the company’s patient-centric approach. This summer I hope to add my problem-solving and analytical skills to a Genzyme team focused on addressing important unmet needs in the healthcare space. My analytical, leadership, and teamwork skills combined with my experience consulting for the pharmaceutical industry make me an ideal fit for the Summer Associate Program. At Putnam Associates, I worked on revenue forecasting, indication prioritization, and market access/pricing projects across multiple therapeutic areas. My projects included extensive work in both oncology and autoimmune disease, and at Genzyme I could leverage my subject matter expertise to contribute to one of the company’s Oncology, Immunology, Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases business units. As a consultant I had to quickly adapt to new problems and deliver quality insights and recommendations to our clients while managing a multi-case workload. This past spring I was responsible for building a global revenue forecasting model for a rheumatology product for one client, and for the identification of opportunities for share growth for an oncology product for another client. At Putnam, I had the opportunity to work collaboratively and take on leadership roles in professional case teams. My most significant leadership experience at the firm was leading a team of four in a treatment paradigm positioning project for a novel CAR T-cell oncology immunotherapy. As my resume indicates, I have strong analytical abilities, leadership skills, and the ability to work well in a team. I believe these attributes make me a strong candidate for the position of Summer Associate at Genzyme. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Carolyn Williams

Ms. Megan Gallagher University Relations, Apple 1 Infinite Loop Cupertino, CA 95014
Dear Ms. Gallagher:
I am a first-year MBA student at the MIT Sloan School of Management, and I am writing to express my interest in the Product Marketing Manager summer internship role at Apple. I had the pleasure of discussing the internship with Della Huff, who left me with a great impression of the energy and passion that exists across the organization. I am confident that through my past experiences using data to drive customer-centric innovation, communicating engaging messages, and building connections with diverse stakeholders, I can be a valuable addition to the Apple team.
In particular, I believe I am a great fit for the Product Marketing internship because I will bring creative fortitude and solid analytical thinking to the position. In my prior role as a consumer insights consultant at C Space, I worked on multiple projects that required me to examine large amounts of qualitative and quantitative data, from which I identified valuable insights that could impact my clients’ business strategy. I used these insights to help envision enhancements for their products, services, communications and marketing campaigns. In a project for a major entertainment company, I identified the barriers preventing wider engagement and adoption of a movie watching desktop and mobile app among different consumer segments after thoroughly analyzing and understanding the mindset of each segment. Using my communication skills to create engaging reports and present compelling stories that brought the insights and consumers to life, I consistently gained traction for my analysis and ideas. In this case, I was able to influence the improvement of the product messaging and positioning. I will be able to draw upon these skills to generate and inform creative and data-driven products and go-to market strategies at Apple.
At C Space I also led cross-functional teams in launching online communities in new global markets, eventually enabling the company to offer services in eight new languages. Even though I did not know some of these languages, I enjoyed the challenge of working in novel and ambiguous situations, and was relentless in ensuring the quality of the work my team and I produced. Through continuous testing and refinement of the international launch process, and constant engagement with key stakeholders in multiple departments of the organization over the two years I owned this globalization effort, I established best practices that allowed C Space to scale its global operations. I am comfortable dealing with uncertainty and I will bring to Apple this love for collaboration and commitment to excellence in all my endeavors.
I am most satisfied when my work leads towards meaningful impact. What attracts me to Apple is the potential to contribute to the creation of products that are re-envisioning the role of technology in society. My professional experiences, coupled with the rigorous quantitative foundation of the MIT Sloan MBA have equipped me to be a great fit as a Product Marketing Manager at Apple. I look forward to exploring this opportunity during the on-campus interview process. Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Stacey Ruskin

December 9, 2015 Erica Ruggiero 60 Wadsworth Street, Apt 10G Cambridge, MA 02142 Ms. Megan Gallagher University Relations Apple 1 Infinite Loop Cupertino, CA 95014 Dear Ms. Gallagher: I am excited to be applying for a Product Marketing Internship position with Apple. I had the pleasure of attending the Apple information session at Sloan and was struck by the passion and drive exhibited by all of the presenters. Product Marketing in particular stood out to me because it blends core business principles with a passion for technology and the product. I believe my technical, communication, and teamwork skills would make me a valuable addition to Apple. As a design engineer at Intel, I worked on products for our server and data center businesses. I was constantly engaged on projects with extensive deliverables and short deadlines. One such project was leading the development of a test chip commissioned by Intel researchers. The test chip had a set of broad specifications that I had to translate first into specific design goals and then into physical circuitry. Once I had a design in place, I coordinated with internal stakeholders to iterate on the design as the experiment for the chip evolved. I set up a series of milestones to ensure that my schedule would be met, and assembled a team of engineers to assist me in the project. I concurrently owned several technical aspects of the project, while also managing the overall project and keeping close communications with the internal customers who would ultimately be using the chip. Despite some significant setbacks late in the project, we managed to deliver the chip ahead of schedule. Towards the end of my time at Intel, I assumed ownership over a large code database which was used by engineers from three different functional roles and across three different Intel projects, all of whom were invested in different aspects of the database. Part of this role was convincing each project team to use the central database, rather than branching off and creating their own version. I achieved this by first modifying the code generation process to be more modular and adaptable to different project specifications. I then demonstrated to each team the benefits in terms of engineering hours and scalability that the central database afforded them. Once I had teams on board, I engaged in significant cross-team communication, prioritizing code change requests from different internal customers and presenting to wide audiences, including project leadership, about the use-model and content of the database. With my strong technical and analytical background, as well as the teamwork, communication and business skills I am developing at Sloan, I know that I can bring a strong, unique perspective to the Apple Product Marketing team. Thank you for your consideration for this position and I look forward to discussing my experience further in a personal interview. Sincerely, Erica Ruggiero

Alissa Speight 10 Emerson Place, Apartment #8A Boston, MA 02114 Ms. Nicole Lonca, MBA Recruiting Sephora USA, Inc. 525 Market Street, 32nd Floor San Franisco, CA 94105-2708 Dear Ms. Lonca: As both a VIB Rouge Member and an MBA, I am thrilled to be applying to the Summer Internship Program at Sephora. Beyond my love of the Sephora store experience, my research on Sephora has left me with a great impression of the company’s work, culture, and people. I am confident that my background in consumer products entrepreneurship and my skills in cross-functional project management, problem-solving, and communication will allow me to create value this summer as a MBA Intern at Sephora. As a founder of a specialty baking company, Zen Cookery, I have firsthand experience in analyzing market trends, building brands, and evaluating opportunities for innovation and growth. I leveraged my personal experience and my knowledge of the local market to strategically focus on customers seeking gluten-free, vegan desserts in cafes and restaurants. I moved from conception and testing to product launch within four months. Utilizing data and customer feedback from retail channels, I made appropriate pricing adjustments and changes to the product line. I also developed and managed strong relationships with local government stakeholders to ensure the appropriate licensing and certification for my products. I came to earn my MBA to transition from a small-scale entrepreneurial food venture to work at a leading consumer products company with global impact. At MIT Sloan, I have taken advantage of opportunities to develop my expertise in strategy while working to create value for consumers. In MIT Sloan’s Design Works program, I was selected to participate in a user-centered business design project with a local food retailer. Through customer interviews and observations, I envisioned and implemented strategic initiatives in menu and packaging redesign to improve the customer experience. I look forward to tackling new challenges and driving creative, innovative, consumer-focused results while engaging my longtime passion for the beauty industry at Sephora this summer. Sephora’s mission and innovative approach to education and professionalism within the beauty industry resonates with my long-term career ambitions to provide people with high-quality products and resources that empower them to take the very best care of themselves and feel beautiful.
